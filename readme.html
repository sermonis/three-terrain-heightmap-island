    <h1>README</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The project consists of rendering a terrain from a heightmap, applying
      textures on it, and adding an entire environment : water, sky, fish, etc.<br/>
    </p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
      This project has been developed in Javascript thanks to the library
      Three.js which is using WebGL APIs.<br/>
      To launch the project, just open index.html in your browser. Firefox is
      recommended, since the development has been done on this browser and no
      major problem has been detected. Using Chrome or another webkit browser
      may lead to an incomplete scene rendering.<br/><br/>
      If any problem occurs, it is recommended to reload the page once.<br/><br/>
      To interact within the scene, you can either click on the buttons to
      change the camera, or use the arrows to move, Q to go UP and W to go DOWN.<br/>
    </p>
    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    <p>
      The index.html is the entry point of the project. It links to all the
      needed files, including the Three.js library and all the Javascript files
      I wrote (located in src/ directory). The ressources used, such as 3D
      models, heightmap or textures, can be found in the ressources/ directory.<br/><br/>
      The src/main.js file is the first Javascript file. It creates the instance of
      object of the scene as well as the camera. It sets the global variables and
      initialize the scene.<br/><br/>
      Animations (fish, water, starship) are handled in the animation.js file.
      Keyboard interactions are handled in the keyboard.js file. Camera changes
      are handled in the camera.js file. terrain.js and skybox.js respectly
      take care of the creation of the terrain and the skybox. life.js creates
      other elements of the scene, such as the fish or the starship.
